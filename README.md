# Python-Course
Projects and exercises from the "Introduction to Python in Engineering" course with Prof. Hermano Cabral at UFPE.

## Practice
There will be lists of exercises to solve on the Codewars platform.

Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. Through discrete programming exercises train a variety of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online IDE.

## Goals
- Programming in Python
- Use the library NumPy to numerical calculus 
- Use the library Matplotlib to generate graphs

## Libraries that will be used

<!---
- **NumPy**
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python

- **SciPy**
SciPy is a set of open source (BSD licensed) scientific and numerical tools for Python. It currently supports special functions, integration, ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers, gradient optimization, parallel programming tools, an expression-to-C++ compiler for fast execution, and others. 
FFT, minimum of functions, statistical operations, clusters analysis, signal and image processing

- **Matplotlib**
It is used for data visualization as a (mainly) 2D plotting library. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc. It is used along with NumPy to provide an environment that is an effective open source alternative for MatLab.
